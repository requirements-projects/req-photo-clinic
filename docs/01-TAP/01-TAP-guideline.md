# Project Charter Template

This document serves as a template for creating a standardized Project Charter. The Project Charter formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.

## Project Charter Structure

### 1. Project Title
> Provide a clear and concise name for the project.

### 2. Project Manager
> Name the person responsible for managing the project.

### 3. Project Sponsor
> Identify the individual or group that provides resources and support for the project and is accountable for enabling success.

### 4. Project Purpose / Objectives
> Describe the fundamental reason for the project. List the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals.

### 5. Justification / Business Case
> Explain why the project is necessary. Describe the problem it solves or the opportunity it addresses. Link it to the organization's strategic goals.

### 6. Assumptions
> List all factors that are considered to be true, real, or certain without proof or demonstration for planning purposes.

### 7. Constraints
> Identify the limitations and restrictions the project faces, such as time, budget, resources, or technology.

### 8. In-Scope Items
> Clearly define the project boundaries by specifying what is included in the project.

### 9. Out-of-Scope Items
> Explicitly state what is **not** included in the project to manage stakeholder expectations.

### 10. Key Stakeholders
> List the key individuals, groups, or organizations that are impacted by or can impact the project.

### 11. Key Deliverables
> List the main tangible or intangible outputs that will be produced by the project.

### 12. Initial Risks
> Identify any potential threats or opportunities that could affect the project's success at this early stage.

### 13. High-Level Timeline / Milestones
> Provide a summary of the project schedule, including major phases and key milestones.

### 14. Success Criteria
> Define the standards, metrics, and requirements that will be used to evaluate the success of the project.

### 15. Project Approval
> Create a section for the formal sign-off from the project sponsor and other key stakeholders.

## Formatting and Structure Guidelines

- **Header and Footer**: The document should include a standard header and footer.
  - **Header**: Typically contains the company logo, project title, and document status (e.g., Draft, In Review, Approved).
  - **Footer**: Should include the page number, document version, and last updated date.

- **Titles and Sections**: Use Markdown's heading hierarchy to structure the document clearly.
  - `# Document Title` (Only one H1 per document)
  - `## Main Section`
  - `### Subsection`

- **Lists and Emphasis**:
  - Use bullet points (-) for unordered lists.
  - Use numbered lists (1., 2.) when order is important.
  - Use **bold** to highlight key terms.

## Content Guidelines

- **Language**: Be clear, concise, and objective. Avoid excessive jargon.
- **Review**: The Project Charter must be reviewed and validated by all key stakeholders before it is formally approved.
